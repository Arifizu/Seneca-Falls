# Conclusion

### In Post
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, the National Park Service and scholarship at large has not discovered who the "unknown" signers of *Declaration of Rights and Sentiments* are. To hope to accomplish in one semester what hasn't been done yet by the historians of women's rights in the past one hundred years is unreal. However, as the NPS hasn't updated their website, and the use of digital techniques to assess the documentation we do have is largely unrepresented, I believed this is where I could make my niche. By utilizing text analysis and GIS mapping, a clearer picture of the regionality of women's rights can be assessed. While most historians of the 19th century know the movement largely started in the northern states of Pennsylvania and New York, a map always helps determine where the "hot zones" were.

### GIS
The GIS map was designed by first obtaining pertinent information for the signers we do have. Whether obtained through monographs, textbooks, or online databases containing biographies of the individual. By doing research on a subject, we can determine where they lived in 1848, and then that information can be entered into GIS to generate a map.

### Text analysis
While many tools exist to analyze text, the one I personally use is called Orange3.
By utilizing Orange3, I can force an unbiased computer to summarize a text, classify the information, assess the tone and intent of the document, investigate the sources, as well as add insight that a human couldn't easily provide.
