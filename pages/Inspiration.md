# So... this has been done?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technically, this project has been done in part by the National Park Service and by Bill Hunt, a historian from Duke who currently teaches at Barton College. While both the NPS and Dr. Hunt's work have parallels to mine in the documentation of the *Declaration* and the signers, only mine attempts to map and use DH to focus in on what new insight technology can bring to the analysis of Seneca Falls.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Hunt's work, I attempt to make a readily accessible resource for the signers while also demonstrating the efficacy of digital techniques. The National Park Service website is surprisingly lacking in information on a majority of the signers, and the information it does have is limited. By utilizing contemporary scholarship and archival materials, I hope that new insight about the signers that are obscure, and the more prolific signers like Mott or Douglass can be found. To the best of my knowledge, (And Bill Hunt's, as he mentions on his own website) there is no complete anthology of the 100 signers of the *Declaration of Sentiments*.
