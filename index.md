## Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seneca Falls Convention was the first women's rights convention to have been held to discuss the social, civil, and religious conditions and rights of women in 19th century America. The convention was held in the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls, New York, and had roughly 300 attendees. The convention would produce the *Declaration of Rights and Sentiments* would go on to spark following conventions like the one held in Rochester, New York just two weeks later.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convention was organized by female Quakers and suffragettes in an attempt to take a step forward for women to have equality with men in the realm of the social and civil sphere. When looking at the signers of the Declaration, a few things will stand out. First, the first few signatures are all taken up by the leading figures of women's rights, such as Lucretia Mott, "Aunt Margaret", and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Second, the men and women signers are segregated, with the women placed above the men. Third, a large majority of other signers are relatively "unknown". The intent of this project is to assess the historiography of feminism to determine not only more about the signers that we do know, but to see the importance and achievements of the signers at large. Also included is a study on early feminism using textual analysis to see the general language and position of 19th century suffragettes, as well as a map generated to determine the regionality of the women's rights movement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the scope of this project will be further reaching than what could be accomplished in one semester, the intent is to develop this into a larger submission to honor the centennial anniversary of the 19th Amendment.

## In closing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, this project requires further research and development to explore the history of the Seneca Falls convention. If taken as a pilot for future work, this website serves as a more recent archive for the signers of the *Declaration of Rights and Sentiments* we know about. Additionally, this website demonstrates the value of traditional research, and that a Digital Humanist needs both the physical and the digital skillsets to succeed.
